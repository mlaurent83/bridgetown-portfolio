# Maëva Laurent-Estavel

**Full-Stack Developer | Passionate about Creating Seamless Digital Experiences**

## Background

Hi!
I am a full-stack web developer, recently trained at the intensive **Le Wagon bootcamp.**
During my time at Le Wagon, I mastered **full-stack development**, building dynamic web applications, and collaborating on diverse tech projects. I am passionate about creating seamless user experiences and innovative digital solutions.

My background includes a **BA in Applied Foreign Languages** and an **MA in Translation Studies**, and I have lived in France, Spain, Portugal, Djibouti, and England. This international experience has enriched my perspective, allowing me to approach web development with a unique and culturally nuanced understanding.

## Skills

I started my coding journey by learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** Later on, I learned **Python** at Stanford's Code in Place. During my coding bootcamp, I learned **Ruby on Rails, GitHub, Bootstrap, SQL,** and much more!
